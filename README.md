Autopitch Tech Stack Portfolio
This repository serves as part of my Autopitch Project, where I showcase a collection of tech stacks and their associated portfolios. Each portfolio page is designed using simple HTML to demonstrate various technology combinations that I am familiar with and plan to use in the future. The repository includes individual pages for each tech stack, providing a brief overview of the respective technologies.

The following tech stacks are featured in this project:

React, Node.js, MongoDB

Angular, .NET, SQL Server

Vue.js, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL

Python, Django, MySQL

Java, Spring Boot, Oracle

Flutter, Firebase, GraphQL

WordPress, PHP, MySQL

Magento, PHP, MySQL

React Native, Node.js, MongoDB

Each page is live on GitHub Pages, with URLs accessible for easy browsing. This project is intended to serve as a personal showcase of my skills and experience with different technology stacks, demonstrating how I can integrate various frameworks and languages to build full-stack applications.
